# MNIST visualization with Tensorflow on tf.keras models
## Visualizing intermediate convolutional layers
Visualizing intermediate convolutional layers of a neural network provides an insight into it such as knowing, for a picture, what pixel regions the model has focused on to predict. Hereby is provided a function to visualize the output of an intermediate convolutional layer from an input image. In this case I work with MNIST images.
## Saliency maps
I also include hereby a function to plot a saliency map given a model and an image.
